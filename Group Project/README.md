### Description:
Full FPGA implementation for MIPS. Define the data-card with ISA support, Memory block RAM usage where the program should be fed through an initial block ram in FPGA. The output should be shown on the 7 segment LED display using memory mapped IO.

### Features (Implemented till date):
- [x] MIPS ISA support.
- [x] Memory block RAM usage.
- [x] Program fed through initial block RAM.
- [x] Full FPGA implementation of 5 stages.
    - [x] Instruction Fetch.
    - [x] Instruction Decode.
    - [x] Execution.
